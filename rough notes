### Advantage of having a Constructor
In software development, it helps to define variables or attributes of the class which will usually not be updated by the user of the application

While the attributes within Constructor are automatically defined, functions need to be invoked

### Advantages of OOPs:
- Create your own datatype (i.e Class)
