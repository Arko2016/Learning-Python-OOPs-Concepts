OOPs : Object Oriented Programming

Basic Concepts:
- Class : user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects
- Object: instance of a class
- Attributes : variables defined within a class, representing the data or properties of an object
- Functions/Methods: represent the actions or behaviors that an object can perform
